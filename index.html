    <p>          
        Hello there, my name is José Carlos Medina, Jr. I am a tech savvy Tennis and Marketing Professional. 
        I have worked with numerous CMS (Content Management Systems) throughout the past 15 years. 
        I worked for the USTA (United States Tennis Association) Florida Section for many years as the Web Site Coordinator and provided IT support as well. 
        Throughout my tenure at the USTA I gained invaluable experience in the web publishing world. More recently, I have been the Web Editor of <b><a href="http://MiamiOpen.com" target="_blank">MiamiOpen.com</a></b>
        for the Miami Open tennis tournament that is held yearly in March in the Miami area.
        I have been the editor for the Miami Open for the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 tournaments.
        It has been a thrill to work in tennis which is my passion, along with managing the day-to-day publishing needs of one of the biggest and most important tennis tournaments in the world.

    <p>
        I'm bilingual, having been born in the Andes Mountain city of <b>La Oroya, Perú</b>.  As you can imagine, I'm an avid tennis …and soccer fan. 
        Let's go <b><a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/" target="_blank">FC Barcelona</a></b>, or as they say in Cataluña - Visca El Barca. Having been around the tennis industry for a while, 
        I have met quite a few tennis playing professionals over the years. In fact, I'm an amateur sports action photographer, please visit my
        <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tennis_image/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></b> page to view my tennis images from different tournaments.

    </p>

    <P>
        My motivation comes from my amazing family, my beautiful wife Lily, and our adorable daughter,  Massiel.

       <i>Last but not least, I decided to enroll in the University of Miami's Coding Boot Camp to gain deep knowledge of all the aspects of the web world.  I will become a Full Stack Web Developer by June 2020. 
        I can't wait to learn and learn and never stop learning about being a Web Developer.</i>

        Hello there, my name is José Carlos Medina, Jr. I am a tech savvy Tennis Professional. I have worked with numerous CMS (Content Management Systems) throughout the past 15 years.
        I worked for the USTA (United States Tennis Association) Florida Section for many years. I was the Website Coordinator there as well as an IT support staffer.
        Throughout my tenure at the USTA I gained invaluable experience in the web publishing world. More recently, I have been the Web Editor of <a href="http://MiamiOpen.com" target="_blank">MiamiOpen.com</a>
        for the Miami Open tennis tournament that is held yearly in the Miami area in March.
        I have been the editor for the Miami Open for the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 tournaments and it has been a thrill to work in tennis which is my passion, combined with the technical aspect of the web site.

       I'm bilingual, having been born in the Andes Mountain city of La Oroya, Peru  and I'm extremely proud to be of Peruvian heritage. As you can imagine, I'm an avid tennis and soccer fan. Let's go Barca or as they say in Cataluña - Visca El Barca.
       Having been in the tennis industry I have met quite a few tennis playing professionals over the years. In fact, I'm an amateur sports action photographer, please visit my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tennis_image/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page to view my tennis images.
       My motivation comes from my beautiful wife Lily and our adorable daughter Massiel, I love them dearly.

       <i>Last but not least, I am enrolled at the University of Miami's Flex Coding Bootcamp where I will become a Full Stack Web Developer by June 2020. I can't wait to learn and learn and keep learning about being a Web Developer.</i>
